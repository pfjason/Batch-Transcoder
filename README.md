## Batch Folder Transcoder

This is a small tool I created for myself for post-processing of downloaded videos and PlayOn recordings.
By default it will scan a directory for media files using the MediaInfo library, and transcode all video files it finds to H.265 (HEVC) / Matroska using FFmpeg.
It will scan the metadata of the video files to determine if it was generated by PlayOn, and if so, by default will remove the commercials and the PlayOn banner from the beginning and end.
Those steps can be disabled using command line parameters.

```
